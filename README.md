Trellis for Drawio extends Draw.io with a coordinated suite of plugins that turn diagrams into interactive, computational garden plans.

Several of the plugins depend on local database access, requiring the slightly modified version of Draw.io included in this repository . The only changes are a file system bridge for Database access, and new built-in plugins.

**Features:**

- Create comprehensive yearly business/garden plans.
- Draw beds, garden zones, and modules.
- Drag crops into place and generate schedules based on climate, GDD, frost windows, and plant traits.
- Plan multi-crop successions and turnovers.
- Manage and coordinate tasks with Automated, linked Kanban boards.
- Build multi-person workflows and ownership using role cards and team modules.
- Automatically track and visualize when diagram elements were created or edited, using time-based coloring, filtering, and navigation to explore change history directly on the canvas.
- In addition to all the base features included in Draw.io

**Who This Is For**

- Home gardeners
- Market gardeners
- School garden programs and teachers
