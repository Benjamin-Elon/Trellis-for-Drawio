Trellis for Drawio extends Draw.io with a coordinated suite of plugins that turn diagrams into interactive, computational garden plans.

Several of the plugins depend on local database access and require this slightly modified version of Drawio. The only changes are a file system bridge for Database access, and new built-in plugins.

The system functions as a garden-planning IDE:

Create yearly business plans.
Draw beds, garden zones, and modules.
Drag crops into place and generate schedules based on climate, GDD, frost windows, and plant traits.
Plan multi-crop successions and turnovers.
Manage tasks with Automated, linked Kanban boards.
Build multi-person workflows using role cards and team modules.
Automatically track and visualize when diagram elements were created or edited, using time-based coloring, filtering, and navigation to explore change history directly on the canvas.
In addition to all the base features included ini Draw.io
