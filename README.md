Trellis for Drawio extends Draw.io with a coordinated suite of plugins that turn diagrams into a spacial garden planning and management system.

**Licensing:** Trellis for Drawio is a mixed-license distribution. Upstream draw.io and third-party material keep their existing notices, while Trellis-owned additions are source-available for community and noncommercial use. Commercial use of Trellis-owned additions requires written approval. See [drawio-desktop/LICENSES.md](drawio-desktop/LICENSES.md).

**Features:**

- Create comprehensive yearly business/garden plans.
- Draw beds, garden zones, and modules.
- Drag crops into place and generate schedules based on climate, GDD, frost windows, and plant traits.
- Plan multi-crop successions and turnovers.
- Design irrigation systems.
- Manage and coordinate tasks with Automated, linked Kanban boards.
- Build multi-person workflows and ownership using role cards and team modules.
- Automatically track and visualize when diagram elements were created or edited, using time-based coloring, filtering, and navigation to explore change history directly on the canvas.
- In addition to all the base features included in Draw.io

I have big plans for this project.

Eventually, I would like this to become a community-level coordination and planning environment.

Collaborative peer-networked diagramming, always local first.
